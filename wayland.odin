/* The singleton global registry object.  The server has a number of
      global objects that are available to all clients.  These objects
      typically represent an actual object in the server (for example,
      an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide
      extension functionality.

      When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
      will emit a global event for each global currently in the
      registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device or
      monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the
      registry will send out global and global_remove events to
      keep the client up to date with the changes.  To mark the end
      of the initial burst of events, the client can use the
      wl_display.sync request immediately after calling
      wl_display.get_registry.

      A client can bind to a global object by using the bind
      request.  This creates a client-side handle that lets the object
      emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on
      the object. */

data_device_manager_interface : interface

/* A surface is a rectangular area that may be displayed on zero
      or more outputs, and shown any number of times at the compositor's
      discretion. They can present wl_buffers, receive user input, and
      define a local coordinate system.

      The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described
      in surface-local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer
      coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform
      or a buffer_scale is used.

      A surface without a "role" is fairly useless: a compositor does
      not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the
      purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a
      pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon
      (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface
      (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a
      shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).

      A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a
      wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a
      role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the
      wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed,
      unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface
      specification.

      Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as
      wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention
      that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this
      request also creates a new protocol object that represents the
      role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a
      client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this role
      object before the wl_surface, otherwise a defunct_role_object error is
      sent.

      Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the
      wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from "playing the role".
      For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface
      it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and
      z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same
      wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as
      a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role
      switching is not allowed). */

	The new size of the surface is calculated based on the buffer

	inverse buffer_scale. This means that at commit time the supplied
	buffer size must be an integer multiple of the buffer_scale. If
	that's not the case, an invalid_size error is sent.

	The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending
	buffer's upper left corner, relative to the current buffer's upper
	left corner, in surface-local coordinates. In other words, the
	x and y, combined with the new surface size define in which
	directions the surface's size changes. Setting anything other than 0
	as x and y arguments is discouraged, and should instead be replaced
	with using the separate wl_surface.offset request.

	When the bound wl_surface version is 5 or higher, passing any
	non-zero x or y is a protocol violation, and will result in an
	'invalid_offset' error being raised. The x and y arguments are ignored
	and do not change the pending state. To achieve equivalent semantics,
	use wl_surface.offset.

	Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.
	wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending
	wl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new
	surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size
	calculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit,
	there is no pending buffer until the next attach.

	Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the
	pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at
	any time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor
	will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the
	wl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release,
	the client may reuse the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been
	attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed
	will not receive a release event, and is not used by the
	compositor.

	If a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface,
	the delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes undefined. A well
	behaved client should not rely on wl_buffer.release events in this
	case. Alternatively, a client could create multiple wl_buffer objects
	from the same backing storage or use a protocol extension providing
	per-commit release notifications.

	Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change
	the surface contents. Destroying the wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release
	is allowed as long as the underlying buffer storage isn't re-used (this
	can happen e.g. on client process termination). However, if the client
	destroys the wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and
	mutates the underlying buffer storage, the surface contents become
	undefined immediately.

	If wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, the
	following wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.

	If a pending wl_buffer has been destroyed, the result is not specified.
	Many compositors are known to remove the surface content on the following
	wl_surface.commit, but this behaviour is not universal. Clients seeking to
	maximise compatibility should not destroy pending buffers and should
	ensure that they explicitly remove content from surfaces, even after
	destroying buffers. */

/* The global interface exposing sub-surface compositing capabilities.
      A wl_surface, that has sub-surfaces associated, is called the
      parent surface. Sub-surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create
      a tree of sub-surfaces.

      The root surface in a tree of sub-surfaces is the main
      surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-surface, because
      sub-surfaces must always have a parent.

      A main surface with its sub-surfaces forms a (compound) window.
      For window management purposes, this set of wl_surface objects is
      to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as
      such.

      The aim of sub-surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work
      within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is
      a video player with decorations and video in separate wl_surface

subcompositor_interface : interface

/* An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which has been
      made a sub-surface. A sub-surface has one parent surface. A
      sub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.
      Particularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its
      parent's area.

      A sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied
      and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens
      first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes
      hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply
      recursively through the tree of surfaces.

      The behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface
      depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are
      synchronized and desynchronized, see methods
      wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized
      mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's
      state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending
      wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the
      synchronized mode.

      Sub-surfaces also have another kind of state, which is managed by
      wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This
      state includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent
      surface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of
      the parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and
      .place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's
      wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
      As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.

      The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
      since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.

      Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
      in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
      synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the
      tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into
      synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child
      sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.

      Destroying a sub-surface takes effect immediately. If you need to
      synchronize the removal of a sub-surface to the parent surface update,
      unmap the sub-surface first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent,
      and then destroy the sub-surface.

      If the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
      unmapped.

      A sub-surface never has the keyboard focus of any seat.

      The wl_surface.offset request is ignored: clients must use set_position

	normally with a wl_surface. Calling wl_surface.commit on the
	parent surface has no effect on the sub-surface's wl_surface
	state. This mode allows a sub-surface to be updated on its own.

	If cached state exists when wl_surface.commit is called in
	desynchronized mode, the pending state is added to the cached
	state, and applied as a whole. This invalidates the cache.

	Note: even if a sub-surface is set to desynchronized, a parent
	sub-surface may override it to behave as synchronized. For details,
	see wl_subsurface.

	If a surface's parent surface behaves as desynchronized, then
	the cached state is applied on set_desync. */
