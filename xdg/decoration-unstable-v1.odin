/* This interface allows a compositor to announce support for server-side
      decorations.

      A window decoration is a set of window controls as deemed appropriate by
      the party managing them, such as user interface components used to move,
      resize and change a window's state.

      A client can use this protocol to request being decorated by a supporting
      compositor.

      If compositor and client do not negotiate the use of a server-side
      decoration using this protocol, clients continue to self-decorate as they
      see fit.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset. */

        different mode instead.

        a set_mode request in response to an xdg_surface.configure event and wait
        for the next xdg_surface.configure event to prevent unwanted state.
