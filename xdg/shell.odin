      an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are

positioner_interface : interface

/* An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
      interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
      toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
      xdg_surface roles.

      Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
      to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
      using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
      xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
      not based on xdg_surface.

      A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
      xdg_surface object.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

      Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
      committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
      manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
      also be treated as errors.

      After creating a role-specific object and setting it up (e.g. by sending
      the title, app ID, size constraints, parent, etc), the client must
      perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor
      will reply with initial wl_surface state such as
      wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale followed by an xdg_surface.configure
      event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a
      buffer to map the surface.

      Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
      possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
      a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

      For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
      conditions must be met:
      (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
      (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
	  role-dependent state to the surface
      (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

      A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
      of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
      has not been destroyed, i.e. the client must perform the initial commit
      again before attaching a buffer. */

	The window geometry is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	When maintaining a position, the compositor should treat the (x, y)
	coordinate of the window geometry as the top left corner of the window.
	A client changing the (x, y) window geometry coordinate should in
	general not alter the position of the window.

	Once the window geometry of the surface is set, it is not possible to
	unset it, and it will remain the same until set_window_geometry is
	called again, even if a new subsurface or buffer is attached.

	If never set, the value is the full bounds of the surface,

	The arguments are given in the surface-local coordinate space of
	the wl_surface associated with this xdg_surface, and may extend outside
	of the wl_surface itself to mark parts of the subsurface tree as part of
	the window geometry.

	When applied, the effective window geometry will be the set window
	geometry clamped to the bounding rectangle of the combined

surface_interface : interface

/* This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to,
      among other things, set window-like properties such as maximize,
      fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
      id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
      resize and move.

      A xdg_toplevel by default is responsible for providing the full intended
      visual representation of the toplevel, which depending on the window
      state, may mean things like a title bar, window controls and drop shadow.

      Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown
      by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.
      All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all
      attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
      an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to
      the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client
      can re-map the toplevel by performing a commit without any buffer
      attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see
      xdg_surface description).

      Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface. */

	The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or
	another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another
	xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being
	the topmost popup.

	Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
	in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the
	topmost one.

	When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every
	nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it
	will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

	If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to
	the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.

	If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this
	popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did
	not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

	During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer
	and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an
	"owner-events" grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
	will always have keyboard focus. */

	by the previous positioner will be discarded.

	The passed token will be sent in the corresponding
	xdg_popup.repositioned event. The new popup position will not take
	effect until the corresponding configure event is acknowledged by the

	opaque, and has no other special meaning.

	If multiple reposition requests are sent, the compositor may skip all
	but the last one.

	If the popup is repositioned in response to a configure event for its
	parent, the client should send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_configure
	and possibly an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request to allow the
	compositor to properly constrain the popup.
